<div class="w3-container">
 <p>i met a girl coming from the hotel
she fine scatter to the extent that no one can tell
the way she moved her waist i almost fell into a well
i went closer to collect her number from her cell

after a long time of our relationship she said we should be friends
she called me a loser dat i am not like other mens
i was already in love am already in a big mess
the girl think wether she is smart she think say she get sense
she broke my heart like she pushed me down a fence

l moved on still feeling the heartbreak and the pain
beign downgraded by love i was never the same
i was consoled by my niggas cos i was going out of lain
i think i had lost my hearth i think i am going insane
i looked at my self i knew wat i became
i hated love i wounderd were it came

after sometime i began to cheer up
started to hustle to move to the mountain top
people thought dat because i was hearth broken i will begin to flop
it came to their suprise dat i didnt drop
i begin to get better and i knew the money was already overflowing like water in a cup
girls was never the problem i can say they were licking me like lolipop

one very day went with my niggas to chill in the bar
staying in the vip sute so her from afar
i worked forward going to meet her
she looked at me and new i was already a big star
she talked to me as if nothing happened btwn us
i knew she was a gold digger infact she is d boss
me cool guy flowing with her and ask her wat she does
she said she is fine dat she is still studying because
she as change and want to make her life better dan it was

i new she was lieng she was trying to make me forget
all the things dat made me cry and made me regret
i just smiled at her and left her and told her it was good as we met
she was shocked dat i didnt fall for her and i was nt traped in her net

i went home that night and dumped my heard under my pillow
still thinking abt the loving time we had foget all the sorrow
i stood up and looked through th window
and enjoyed the breeze blow
and i thought and ask my self that is this how life goes
i just had to force myself to sleep to prepare for work tomorrow

coming to my suprise the girl came to visit me at my work place
i greeted her as she walk in into my office
she smiled at me looking at my face she came closer holding my hand and putting it on her waist
she kissed me at a fast rate
and kept my head on her breast without disgrace
before i could even think she went and grab my big maize
i could not control my self i havnt feel dat good for a long time
i felt the love dat we had b4 and as if nothing happened all this days 
i just forced myself and pushed her away and told her to stop
 dat she wont get nothig out of me not even a dime
she said she was sorry for what she did that she didnt no dat things will turn back as it seems
i told her i loved her and ask her wat was my crime
she said she was blinded by th light that she loved me from the base
then i told her that it is to late that everything she did to get me back was just a waste.</p>
